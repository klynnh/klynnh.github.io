    <h2>All About Us<h2>
      <h3>Established in 1998, our company may be one of the younger ones in the area, but we do celebrate our community's history.
          In the summer of '98, The Ice Cream Factory opened its doors to the public for the first time on June 15th. Just in time 
          for the annual town-wide Start of Summer Festival. Now, 20 years later, The Ice Cream Factory still celebrates the
          momentous occasion by serving free ice cream in the first three flavors that was served on that wonderful day in June.
